As part of the senior project, I had to create a blog. There are many different tools that you could use to create a blog, but I chose `distill` package in R to create my blog. I would like to show how I created this blog using distill package in R with github. This post will show you very basic of creating a blog and a blog post.

First, open up R studio and install `distill` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("distill")
```


Next, go to `github.com` and create a repo. Name your repo name as `your_github_userid.github.io`. My example shows invalid because I already have my repo named in that convention.

After you create your repo, copy the url of your repo and open R Studio again.

In R Studio, create a new project. When creating a new project, choose `version control` and choose `git` options.

Paste the URL of your repo and select the directory that you want to save your file.

After the project is created, run the following command to create a blog using `distill` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
distill::create_blog(dir = getwd(), title = "your blog name")
```

`dir` command let you choose where you want to create a blog. In this case, I'm creating a blog file to my current working directory and that is why I'm using `getwe()`. Name your blog in `title`.

After you run the command and the blog files are created, you need to quit and restart the R studio.

After you restart your R studio, you can find a `Build` tab on your right upper side panel of R Studio. Click `Build` tab and click `Build Website`.
